Apex University needs a scalable, secure network to support its eight campuses. Each campus will have a Local Area Network (LAN) for communication, with a centralized DNS server, DHCP for automated IP management, and OSPF for dynamic routing. This design ensures strong performance, scalability, and future adaptability.
